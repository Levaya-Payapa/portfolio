                <h1>About Levi DeWitt</h1>
                <h2>
                    Motion Designer | Video Editor
                </h2>
                <div class="about-scrolling-text">
                    <p>Hello, and thank you for visiting my Motion Design Portfolio! It’s been a great pleasure putting this collection together, and I hope you’ve enjoyed exploring it.</p>
                    <p>My name is Levi DeWitt, and I’m an American-Canadian Motion Designer and Video Editor with three years of experience as an Editor/Motion Designer II at Leggett & Platt’s Creative Services corporate department. I specialize in animation using Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro, and I’ve recently expanded into 3D animation with Blender.</p>
                    <p>Outside of work, I am husband to the amazing Robyn DeWitt, plant-dad to many houseplants (most of which are actually alive!), and dog-dad to an extra fluffy Cavapoo named Henry Cavillier. Robyn and I got married in September 2024 and are eagerly planning our honeymoon in Scotland for this coming spring!</p>
                    <p>I graduated in 2020 from Pittsburg State University in Kansas, earning a degree in Graphic Communications. I also studied business abroad for two semesters at Chung Yuan Christian University in Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>I’ve been fortunate to live and work in some incredible places around the world. I spent a year volunteering at Casa de Esperansa in Bolivia, four summers as a commercial salmon fisher in Alaska, a year in Taiwan studying and interning at Overseas Radio & Television Inc., and six months teaching English at Happy&Co. in Brazil. These experiences gave me the chance to immerse myself in new languages and cultures, one of the opportunities for which I am the most grateful in my life.</p>
                    <p>Through my travels, I’ve gained C1 proficiency in Spanish, B2 proficiency in Brazilian Portuguese, and HSK 3 proficiency in Mandarin Chinese. Beyond the languages, I’ve fallen in love with the unique beauty of each culture I’ve experienced—and, of course, the food! My passion for cooking began as I learned to recreate the incredible dishes I tasted abroad, and it has since become one of my favorite hobbies.</p>
                    <p>When I’m not working or cooking, Robyn and I dive into all kinds of nerdy pursuits. We love anime, with <em>Frieren</em> and <em>Spy x Family</em> holding top spots on our list. Our friends introduced us to tabletop RPGs, leading me to DM a few <em>D&D</em> campaigns, and we’re currently hooked on <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. Looking ahead, we dream of moving to Europe and embracing the international community full-time.</p>
                    
                    <h3>About This Website</h3>
                    <p>This website is a passion project that’s been years in the making. With only a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, I was initially intimidated by the scope of building a portfolio site from scratch. However, with the help of AI (shout-out to my code-jockey ChatGPT!), I finally turned that dream into reality.</p>
                    <p>The website was built using:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
                        <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
                        <li>GitHub Pages</li>
                        <li>Adobe After Effects, Premiere Pro, Media Encoder, and Illustrator</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In many ways, this site is as much a feature item in my portfolio as the projects it showcases.</p>
                    <p>Thank you once again for taking the time to explore my work. It means a lot to me!</p>

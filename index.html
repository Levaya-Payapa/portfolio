                <h2>
                    Motion Designer | Video Editor
                </h2>
                <div class="about-scrolling-text">
                    <p>Hi there—thanks for stopping by my motion design portfolio! Putting this collection together has been a lot of fun, and I hope you’ve enjoyed exploring it.</p>
                    <p>I’m Levi DeWitt, an American-Canadian Motion Designer and Video Editor with several years of experience working for a Fortune 500 company. I primarily use Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro, and lately I’ve been diving into 3D animation with Blender.</p>
                    <p>Outside of work, I’m husband to the incredible Robyn DeWitt, plant dad to a jungle of (mostly living) houseplants, and dog dad to our extra fluffy Cavapoo, Henry Cavillier. Robyn and I got married in September 2024 and just returned from our honeymoon in Scotland—it was incredible!</p>
                    <p>I graduated from Pittsburg State University in Kansas in 2020 with a degree in Graphic Communications, and also spent two semesters studying business abroad at Chung Yuan Christian University in Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>I’ve been lucky to live and work in some pretty amazing places. I spent a year volunteering at an orphanage in Bolivia, four summers commercial salmon fishing in Alaska, a year studying and interning in Taiwan, and six months teaching English in Brazil. Those experiences gave me the chance to immerse myself in new cultures and languages—something I’m incredibly grateful for.</p>
                    <p>Along the way, I’ve reached C1 proficiency in Spanish, B2 in Brazilian Portuguese, and HSK 3 in Mandarin Chinese—and I’m currently learning French. Beyond the languages, I’ve fallen in love with the cultures I’ve encountered—especially the food. Cooking started as a way to recreate the dishes I missed from my travels, and has grown into one of my favorite hobbies.</p>
                    <p>When I’m not working or cooking, Robyn and I are usually diving into something nerdy. We love <em>Epic</em> the musical, we’re big anime fans—<em>Frieren</em> and <em>Spy x Family</em> are top-tier in our book—and we’re deep into tabletop RPGs. I’ve even DM’d a couple <em>D&D</em> campaigns, including a pirate-themed one we’re playing through now.</p>
                    <p>Looking ahead, we’re hoping to move to Canada and build a life in an international, creative community.</p>
                    
                    <h3>About This Website</h3>
                    <p>This website is a passion project that’s been years in the making. With only a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, I was initially intimidated by the scope of building a portfolio site from scratch. However, with the help of AI (shout-out to my code-jockey ChatGPT!), I finally turned that dream into reality.</p>
                    <p>The website was built using:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
                        <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
                        <li>GitHub Pages</li>
                        <li>Adobe After Effects, Premiere Pro, Media Encoder, and Illustrator</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In many ways, this site is as much a feature item in my portfolio as the projects it showcases.</p>
                    <p>Thank you once again for taking the time to explore my work. It means a lot to me!</p>
